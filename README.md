# RayTracer
Simple Ray Tracer in C++

This project is part of the pair with HaskellTracer. When I evaluate new languages I like to write a ray tracer. This is because 
Ray Tracers are highly parallelizable, so it makes for a nice platform to learn about the concurrency stuff. It's also cpu
bound, so it gives a nice idea of optimizations. Also, I've written the damned things so many times that it's not overly taxing
but at the same time is more complex then a Hello World.

In any event, nothing Earth shattering here. If you're curious to compare trivial Ray Tracers in C++ and Haskell, this might prove
interesting.
